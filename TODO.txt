TO DO:
* responsive thing
* track total score

ALREADY DONE:
* make new events 'tiles-match' and 'tiles-mismatch' and move setTimeout logic to React
* remove boardFreeze
* isFlippedMap does not need to be a map, it can be a simple object (one value), change it to flippedTile = {rowIndex, columnIndex};

WHAT CAN BE BETTER:
* make game class which will track levels, total score (startNewGame(), startNextLevel(), startCurrentLevelAgain())
* css in js
* createClass instead of es6 crap
* why-did-you-update || react-render-visualizer
* better random function
* tileMismatches has to be immutable!!
* static container, pure component!!
* git comments
